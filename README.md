libctemplate, a C HTML Template Library
==========================================

Welcome to libctemplate. This library and the template language that it implements are inspired by the perl HTML::Template package. The template language has HTML-like tags for variable substitution, file inclusion, if statements, and loop statements. The library has functions for building a list of variables and for passing the variables to a template file for output. A stand alone program for expanding template files comes with the library. For details, see the documentation. To download, go to sourceforge.

The C Template Library is for generating output. If you are writing a CGI program, then you may find the libccgi C CGI Library useful for processing CGI input data.
